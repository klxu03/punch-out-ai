# Coding Guidelines 
- My project uses the NextJS framework
- The primary programming language is TypeScript
- Voice generation and conversational AI is provided by ElevenLabs' React SDK: https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/libraries/react
- Always add documentation when creating new functions and classes
- Create a local environment variable file and add it to my .gitignore
- Only import packages that are needed for the project, don't introduce unnecessary dependencies and complexity
