Alright champion, let's get ready for some training! I'm Cus, and I'll be your coach today.
Remember, boxing isn't just about throwing punches - it's about precision, timing, and staying focused.
When you see the numbers, follow along with these moves:
One is a Jab
Two is a Cross
Three is a Left Hook
Four is a Right Hook
Five is a Left Uppercut
Six is a Right Uppercut

Keep your guard up, stay light on your feet, and follow my lead.
Let's begin!
